We chose to expand the area of our research to investigate global trends in covid cases in a few different ways. We wanted to look at the reactions â€” published documents or articles during 2020, as well as more case data. We looked at socioeconomic status and life expectancy as it related to case count, and finally clustered to attempt to determine what traits made countries good or bad at recovering from covid. As compared to our other project using only Massachusetts, we expanded our range and used more advanced statistical techniques.
